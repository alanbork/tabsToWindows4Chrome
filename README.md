# tabsToWindows4Chrome
chrome extension: New tabs become new windows - the return of TABless browsing 

Any new tab is moved to it's own window immediately (unless control is held down when the tab is made).

Downsides: flicker as the tab is briefly loaded into the current window and then moved (looking for a fix but have tried easy options)

Upsides: never mistakenly opens a new link as a new window when it would have just been a navigation target, unlike my other extension, NewWindowDefault.

Why unpacked: I don't trust extensions I can't read first, this is 20 lines of code and I encourage you to look at it before adding to your browser.
